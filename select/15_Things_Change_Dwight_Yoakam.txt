She said, baby things change
I said, but i feel the same
She said, well let me explain
Baby, how things can change
I said, but that doesn't show
How a love that could grow
Would become so estranged
She said, well baby, things change
Chorus:
She said, na, na, na, na, na
Now, now, now
Baby, don't try
To figure this out
Or ask questions 'bout why
Forever's a promise
No love can survive
And trust with hearts
Just don't apply
She said,
'Cause baby, things change
Chorus
Na, na, na, na, na, now, now,
So baby
I quit tryin'
To figure things out
About all your hearts lyin'
Forever's a promise
We couldn't survive
Hey, i may be slow
But i ain't blind
She said, i still love you so
I said, i don't care to know
She said, you once cried my name
I said, well baby, things change
And let's don't go placing no blame
'Cause you know things can change
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
She said, you once cried my name
I said, well, baby, things change
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Let's don't go placing no blame
'Cause you know things can change
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
