Well, you wore out a brand new trunk
Packin' and unpackin' your junk
Your mama's mad, she done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave

Well, this ain't right and that is wrong
You just keep naggin' all the day long
It's gotta stop, I don't mean please
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave

The way to keep a woman happy, make her do what's right
Is love her every mornin' and do the same at night
Your mama's mad, she done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave

But every time you get mad
You pack your rags, go back to what you had
You tell her lies she don't believe
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave

You're gonna change your way of livin', change the things you do
Stop doin' all the things that you oughtn't to
Your mama's mad, she done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave

Oh, you're gonna change or I'm gonna leave
