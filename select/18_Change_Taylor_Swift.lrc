[00:20.80] And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
[00:25.69] Somebody else gets what you wanted again
[00:30.76] You know it's all the same, another time and place
[00:36.04] Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
[00:59.54] 
[00:40.39] But I believe in whatever you do
[00:44.89] And I'll do anything to see it through
[01:03.89] 
[00:48.53] Because these things will change, can you feel it now?
[00:54.10] These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
[00:58.96] This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
[01:09.09] And we'll sing hallelujah
[01:13.87] We'll sing hallelujah, oh
[01:26.37] 
[01:23.39] So we've been outnumbered, raided and now cornered
[01:28.64] It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
[01:33.30] We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
[01:38.21] They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared
[02:05.71] 
[01:43.39] You can walk away, say we don't need this
[01:47.51] But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this
[02:16.01] 
[01:51.42] 'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
[01:56.40] These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
[02:01.53] This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
[02:11.45] And we'll sing hallelujah
[02:16.41] We'll sing hallelujah, oh
[02:28.91] 
[02:43.52] Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
[02:48.52] Fight for what we've worked for all these years
[02:53.45] And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
[02:58.42] But we'll stand up champions tonight
[03:16.42] 
[03:03.36] It was the night things changed, can you see it now?
[03:08.80] These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
[03:13.99] It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
[03:23.85] And we'll sing hallelujah
[03:28.98] We sang hallelujah
[03:34.79] Hallelujah
