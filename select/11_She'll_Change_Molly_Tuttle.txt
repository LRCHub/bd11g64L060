She don't worry 'bout tomorrow
She got plenty on her mind
Don't have to beg, steal or borrow
Just snaps her little fingers and they all stand in line

She's never heard a word of vision
She don't defend or deny
In a beat, she's got every single piece
She needs to survive
And daddy by her side

She can paint the sun at midnight
Roll out the moon at the break of day
One wind, many wonders
One road, many ways
Just when you think you know her, she'll change

She knows just how to turn the tables
She'll leave you tongue tied talking blind
And notice when she tells a fable
She'll have you hangin' like a picture of a fool off every line

Don't look too careful though, you'll miss her
She lights up every silver screen
And if you dare to wish her well
Better watch yourself
'Cause all bets are off
She'll take you for everything

She can paint the sun at midnight
Roll out the moon at the break of day
One world, many wonders
One road, many ways
Just when you think you know her, she'll change

If you're so fortunate to love her
Don't let a moment pass you by
'Cause time's running thin
She'll be on the move again
Before you even say the word 'goodbye'

She can paint the sun at midnight
Roll out the moon at the break of day
One world, many wonders
One road, many ways
Just when you think you know her, she'll change
