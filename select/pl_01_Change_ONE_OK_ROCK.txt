If we're not moving forward
Then what are we moving for?
Feels like we're losing order
Fighting a losing war
We need to work this out
Can't do this by myself
How did we let it go this far?
Hey
You know it's not too late
for us to make a change
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?
No matter how much we might bend
we will not break
'cause we got what it takes to stay
I know we got the power
Masters of our own fate
Together we are stronger
As long as we got faith
この声で響かす
SOSのサイン
道なき道を進み 目指す場所へ
Hey
You know it's not too late
for us to make a change
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?
No matter how much we might bend
we will not break
'cause we got what it takes to stay
Stay with me now
And how you like it now?
Just stay with me now
Looking out
We're looking out we're looking out now
Stay with me now with me with me now
Stay we're looking out
Looking out looking out looking out
Hey
You know it's not too late
for us to make a change
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?
No matter how much we might bend
we will not break
'cause we got what it takes to stay
Stay with me now
And how you like it now?
Just stay with me now
Looking out
We're looking out we're looking out now
Stay with me now with me with me now
Stay we're looking out
Looking out stay
